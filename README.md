## Visualise the info

To visualize info click in this [page](https://thawk18.github.io/D3-challenge/) and feel free to examine the data yourself.

### Process

We had a nearly complete HTML file where just added a feature to enable the animations, 1 dataset in csv and css styles all set up. We'd basically need to code the app files in javascript.

## Your Tasks

### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler (Required Assignment)

Final result nearly similar to the provided example

### Bonus: Impress the Boss (Optional Assignment)

Final result nearly similar to the provided example

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

You're going to include more demographics and more risk factors. Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.

* Hint: Try binding all of the CSV data to your circles. This will let you easily determine their x or y values when you click the labels.

#### 2. Incorporate d3-tip

While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. Use the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged)—we've already included this plugin in your assignment directory.

* Check out [David Gotz's example](https://bl.ocks.org/davegotz/bd54b56723c154d25eedde6504d30ad7) to see how you should implement tooltips with d3-tip.



* Completion of all steps in the core assignment

* Coherency of scatter plot (labels, ticks)

* Visual attraction

* Professionalism

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

**Good luck!**
