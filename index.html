          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Indicators and US State Demographic Features</h2>
          <p>By clicking into the Graph it is possible to visually dinamically the different relationships between 
            betwen 3 Health Indicators (Obesity, Smoking Prevalence and No Healthcare Assistance) and 
            3 Socio-Economic Indicators (Poverty, Age and Household Income) for each US State. This represents a total of 9 relationships that
            will be easily compared. 
          </p>

          <p>One way to help this analysis is by fixing one of the Socio-Economic Indicators and observe the variations when changing the 
            Health Indicators. This way it is possible to quickly draw some general conclusions:
            <p> - <b>Poverty</b> is correlated positively with all the Health Indicators, tendentially the poorer is the State
              the more likely to find obese people, smokers and lack of healthcare assistance.
            </p>
            <p> - Concerning the <b>Age</b>, it's not as clear to withdraw a tendency however Obesity and Smoking seem to 
            tendentially affect less "younger" state, while some of the states with older population are more covered with 
            healthcare, which would be expectable, however with some exceptions and dim difference</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> - When we reach <b>Household income</b>, the graph shows us instead a negative tendency,
            higher is the household income the less is the propensity for obesity, smoking or to have no 
            healthcare access</p>
            <p></p>


          </p>

          <p>Some outliers are easily spotted in the graph where it is possible to validate the data with the help of common knowledge.
            <p>- Utah remarkable young age which is likely related with its Mormon communities</p>
            <p>- The same can be seen with Smoking, the more conservative Utah presenting less</p>
            <p>- Texas with the lowest healthcare protection and its Republican reputation </p>
            <p>- Massachusetts in contrast present very high healthcare protection being a state linked to more left leaning voter </p>
